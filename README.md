## Multi-Agent Design

AI-OS demonstrates specialized cooperative agents:

- Monitoring Agent
- Stability Agent
- Governance Agent
- Response Agent
- Oversight Agent

```

# Why This Project Exists

Most AI systems fail gradually — not instantly.

They degrade through:

- rising latency  

- retrieval quality decay  

- hallucination drift  

- KPI misalignment  

- infrastructure instability  

- compounding weak signals  

Traditional dashboards expose metrics but often fail to answer:

> Is the AI deployment still stable?

AI-OS Framework was built to solve that problem.

---

# What AI-OS Does

AI-OS converts fragmented operational telemetry into a bounded survivability score:

# AI Deployment Stability Index (ADSI)

This enables:

- early degradation detection  

- governance tier escalation  

- anomaly monitoring  

- enterprise risk visibility  

- survivability-focused operations

# ADSI Formula
```math id="r1"
ADSI = (AHI + IHI + DHI) / 3
```
Where:

* AHI = Alignment Health Index
* IHI = Infrastructure / Retrieval Health Index
* DHI = Drift Health Index

Bounded range:

ADSI ∈ [0,1]


# Stability Tiers
```
Score | Tier | Operational Meaning

≥ 0.85 | 🟢 Stable | Normal operations

0.75–0.85 | 🟡 Warning | Watch closely

0.65–0.75 | 🟠 Degrading | Investigate now

< 0.65 | 🔴 Critical | Immediate mitigation

```

## Example Usage

```python
from src.framework import evaluate
result = evaluate(
    ahi=0.91,
    ihi=0.87,
    dhi=0.82
)
print(result)
```

Output:
```python
{
  "score": 0.867,
  "tier": "Stable"
}
```

# Why This Project Matters

AI is moving into critical business workflows.

That means organizations need more than dashboards.

They need systems that can:

* detect instability early
* quantify operational risk
* guide intervention decisions
* improve deployment reliability

AI-OS Framework is a blueprint for that future.
